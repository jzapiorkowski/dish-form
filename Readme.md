## How to run the app

You can run the app by typing `docker compose up` in the project directory, just make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed
Alternatively you can run the app natively by typing `npm install && npm run dev`, in this case you have to have node and npm installed. I used 16.10.0 and 8.9.0 versions respectively

## How to run unit tests

In order to run unit tests just type\
in docker:

- `docker exec dish-form npm run test`

or natively:

- `npm run test`
